  abstract = {Primordial cosmological perturbations are the seeds that were cultivated by inflation and the succeeding dynamical processes, eventually leading to the current Universe. In this work, we investigate the behavior of the gauge-invariant scalar and tensor perturbations under the general extended disformal transformation, namely, \$g\_\{\textbackslash mu\textbackslash nu\} \textbackslash rightarrow A(X,Y,Z)g\_\{\textbackslash mu\textbackslash nu\} + \textbackslash Phi\_\textbackslash mu\textbackslash Phi\_\textbackslash nu\$, where \$X \textbackslash equiv -\textbackslash tfrac\{1\}\{2\}\textbackslash phi\textasciicircum\{;\textbackslash mu\}\textbackslash phi\_\{;\textbackslash mu\}, Y \textbackslash equiv \textbackslash phi\textasciicircum\{;\textbackslash mu\}X\_\{;\textbackslash mu\}, Z \textbackslash equiv X\textasciicircum\{;\textbackslash mu\}X\_\{;\textbackslash mu\} \$ and \$\textbackslash Phi\_\textbackslash mu \textbackslash equiv C\textbackslash phi\_\{;\textbackslash mu\} + DX\_\{;\textbackslash mu\}\$, with \$C\$ and \$D\$ being a general functional of \$(\textbackslash phi,X,Y,Z)\$. We find that the tensor perturbation is invariant under this transformation. On the other hand, the scalar curvature perturbation receives a correction due the conformal term only; it is independent of the disformal term at least up to linear order. Within the framework of the full Horndeski theory, the correction terms turn out to depend linearly on the gauge-invariant comoving density perturbation and the first time-derivative thereof. In the superhorizon limit, all these correction terms vanish, leaving only the original scalar curvature perturbation. In other words, it is invariant under the general extended disformal transformation in the superhorizon limit, in the context of full Horndeski theory. Our work encompasses a chain of research studies on the transformation or invariance of the primordial cosmological perturbations, generalizing their results under our general extended disformal transformation.},
